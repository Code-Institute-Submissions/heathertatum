<h1>Milestone Project for Code Institute Full Stack Development course:</h1>
<h2><i>An Artist's Website for Heather Tatum</i></h2>

<b>To view the demo <a href="https://oliviatatum.github.io/heathertatum/index.html">click here</a></b>

<h2>Motivation behind the project</h2>

This website is to showcase the work of Heather Tatum, an artist (and also my mother!), and to let the reader get to know the person behind the work.
Although she has a social media presence on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Etsy, she did not have a website dedicated to her and her work, 
so this site was created to fill that gap.

<h2>Layout of the site</h2>

On the landing page, there is a short introduction piece and a portrait of the artist. Then in the centre of the page, her most 
recently listed pieces and three best sellers are displayed, with links to their individual pages on her Etsy site.
Next to these are some testimonials from previous customers. 

The header contains the artists name in bold lettering, linking back to the homepage, and has her art featured on either 
side to form an eyecatching banner. Underneath this is a navigation bar with links to: HOME, ABOUT, MEDIA, SHOP and CONTACT
pages. All links are to pages within the site, with the exception of the shop link, which takes the user to the artist's Etsy 
shop in a new tab.
In the footer there are icons linking to the artist's Facebook, Instagram, Etsy and Pinterest pages. Then the copyright is included.

The ABOUT page features a timeline of Heather's time as an artist, then a biography with photos.

The MEDIA page has a Pinterest widget showing the artist's activity, then a video embedded from Youtube giving a demonstration of her 
painting. Underneath the video is a Spotify player with Vivaldi, an artist Heather enjoys listening to while she works. Finally on this page
is a widget from Instagram, featuring photos displaying Heather's art and life.

The CONTACT page has a form for the user to contact Heather directly, for commissions or collaboration requests, or any other inquiries.
